# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Note: this is a complete update and revision (2022-04-12) of a very incomplete version originally submitted on 2022-02-06. 

At the time, the intention to return to the assignment was noted. However, the work was then largely set aside, remaining intermittent while other items took over, including a major team project. Now two major team projects. The Weather Dashboard was subsequently revisited earlier last month with additional research, code refactoring, and review of fundamentals with the assistance of a BCS Tutor. Due to other obligations it was not possible to complete the work until now. The GitHub repository is: https://github.com/mcleanGit/WeatherMan. And the deployed application can be found here:  TODO GitHub Pages.

The original assignment task is shown here:
Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Use the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities. Read through the documentation for setup and usage instructions. You will use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
 THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
 THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
 THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
 THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
 THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
